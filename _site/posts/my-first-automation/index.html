  <main><p>Recently, I've been slowly getting more comfortable with managing and developing my tiny little git projects. From my perspective, they're definitely not enterprise-ready by any means. However, I've also been noticing all of the tedious, or just flat-out annoying steps that have to be taken just to accomplish a simple task.</p>
<p>I come from a video-editing and YouTube-publishing background. My general &quot;production pipeline&quot; consisted of Editing, Rendering, and Publishing tasks. It's simple and it acted as a good subconscious progress indicator, preventing me from overwhelming myself with all sorts of disorganized micro-tasks.</p>
<p>Now that digital media production is a remnant of my past, and now refocusing my attention on software development, . But, of course the software development workflow has to throw me all outta wack.</p>
