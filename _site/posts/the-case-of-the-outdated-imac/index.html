  <main><h1>Preface</h1>
<p>I have an old 2010 iMac (<em>A1311</em>) who's main function is to sit on top of my minifridge and look pretty.</p>
<p>In terms of its functionality, it once ran MacOS version <strong>10.13 High Sierra</strong> to some extent. But, because I'm a Linux freak, I've made
multiple attempts at installing Linux, hoping it would be a good solution for updating it's since discontinued operating system. However, each time I've installed a new distribution (I've tried many) I consistently find myself at a black screen on first boot into the installed system. Sometimes, if I'm lucky enough, I even get a black screen on first boot into the installed, live environment! So, what's going on here?</p>
<hr>
<h1>Things I've Noticed</h1>
<p>While Macs are often problematic when it comes to customization, I've determined that the overarching design decisions made by Apple here are not entirely to blame.</p>
<p>I've managed to get Linux installed on several other Apple products from the 2009-2011 era, and have had moderate success. The only issues I really have are due to the fact that the hardware and chassis are over 10 years old now and are deteriorating. This also plays a major role as to why I'm having my problem with this specific device.</p>
<h1>The Issue</h1>
<p>The problem here is due to outdated graphics card drivers. This iMac is equipped with an <em>ATI Radeon HD 4670</em>. To get a better grasp of the timeline, according to the limited responses on da forums, these drivers were last supported in Ubuntu <em>14.04</em> (ca. 2014)
and I believe they have been depricated and removed in later versions of the linux kernel, terminating support after version 3.4. I guess that's to be expected, since ATI Technologies was purchased by AMD and subsequently dissolved by 2010.</p>
<hr>
<h1>The Current Solution</h1>
<p>The solution that every single support forum told me was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Include <code>nomodeset</code> in your grub boot parameters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it does work! Not very well, but at least I'm able to use the computer.</p>
<p>If you're a beginner and don't know how to do this yourself, do a search for <strong>How to add GRUB boot parameters</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>NOTE: I'm a little paranoid with using direct links to webpages because they always break over time. But knowing exactly what to search for always works in the end.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1>Further Testing</h1>
<p>So, the above solution will work in the majority of cases, but as I've also implied, its not satisfactory for my needs. By using <code>nomodeset</code>, we disable hardware acceleration, which isn't ideal. This is where a little more research will come into play. It would be nice if I could remove the unsupported GPU, or bypass it to use Intel integrated graphics. Though, I have a feeling it wont be that simple. I'll post updates if anything new develops.</p>
