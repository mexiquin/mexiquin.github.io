  <main><h1>Experiment Numero 1</h1>
<p>The last time I used this hugo theme, I had a problem with new posts not appearing in the <strong>Writings</strong> headline at the bottom
of the page.</p>
<p>My hope is that this bug was fixed, or that I actually understand how to use this software now.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>From my testing, it appears that everything is working as expected! Thx hugo 😊</p>
