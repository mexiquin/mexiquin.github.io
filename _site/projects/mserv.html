<p>This article discusses version 0.8, as well as all minor updates <strong>(eg. 0.8.2).</strong> There is a chance that some of this information will not be valid after some time. But, my goal is to keep the basic functionality extremely similar, if not the same, throughout the lifetime of this project
***
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mserv</code>‚Äôs main function is to act as an abstraction layer on top of the official Mojang server binary. In other words, it shoots commands to a different program so that you don‚Äôt have to.</p>

<p>Whenever I searched for a way to make my own Minecraft server, and execute it on my own hardware, the only results that Google gave me completely ignored my question and just told me to purchase a hosting plan. I didn‚Äôt even <em>know</em> Mojang offered their own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server.jar</code> file until just recently!</p>

<p>While you <em>can</em> host your own server using just this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server.jar</code> file, I found it to be a tad clunky (All server files were generated in the working directory. You‚Äôre on your own organizing those files if you didn‚Äôt already create a new server directory), and the process could definitely be automated a bit more</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mserv</code> is a little script written in Python that is able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan the Mojang website for the server.jar file, and download it automatically</li>
  <li>Organize servers into their own directories (each server and its files belong to a unique folder named by the user)</li>
  <li>Execute the server binary</li>
  <li>Provide network information to make joining the server easier</li>
  <li>Cute command-line UI elements (progress bars, colored text) to help make the CLI feel less intimidating, and more informative for normal people</li>
</ul>

<p>When installed using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip</code>, the binary is located within the computer‚Äôs PATH, which means that you can spawn new servers wherever you want, based on your current working directory.</p>

<h1 id="installing-mserv">Installing mserv</h1>

<h2 id="the-easy-way">The Easy Way</h2>
<p>The recommended way to install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mserv</code> is by using Python‚Äôs pip package manager. If you don‚Äôt already have Python installed, head on over to <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python.org</a> and install it on your computer.</p>

<p>As of right now, it‚Äôs recommended that you install Python version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.8.0</code> or newer.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: If you‚Äôre on Windows, make sure that, at the very end of the installation, you select the checkbox that ‚ÄúAdds python to PATH‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Once Python is installed, run this command in your Terminal/Console</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--user</span> mserv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which will install everything and you should be all good to go.</p>

<h1 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h1>
<h2 id="simple-commands">Simple Commands</h2>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mserv</code> is a command-line application. For those not familiar, you have to give commands to the program by typing to it.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new server at the current location, you would execute this code:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mserv setup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and mserv will guide you through the process of setting up the server.</p>

<h2 id="command-list">Command List</h2>
<pre><code class="language-plain">Usage: mserv [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  run Execute the server (if multiple, prompt to make a choice will appear)
  setup   Create a new server.
  update  Download a fresh server.jar file from Mojang.
</code></pre>

<h1 id="port-forwarding">Port Forwarding</h1>
<p>This is the part that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mserv</code> can not help you with, but its worth talking about and make sure you‚Äôre aware of it.</p>

<p><em>Essentially, port forwarding allows for your router to accept connections from the outside world. Someone that is not connected to your internet will be able to log on to your server if they know your Public IP address and the port that the server is running on. If you <strong>don‚Äôt</strong> port forward, your server will only be accessible on your network. Its great if you‚Äôre having a LAN party, but chances are you want to connect with long-distance friends too.</em></p>

<p>I can‚Äôt really offer an extensive guide for how to do this, since every router is different. You will have to do some independent research for how to operate your own router. Though, the general steps are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Figure out your server‚Äôs ip address</strong></p>

    <p>You‚Äôre going to want to figure out the local ip address of the computer you‚Äôre hosting the server on.</p>

    <p><em>NOTE: The local IP address is the address that only works on your network. The rest of the world can‚Äôt access it.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>On <strong>Windows</strong>, open a command prompt and enter the command:
        <div class="language-powershell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ipconfig/all</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p><img src="/assets/images/mserv/win_ip_addr.png" alt="Windows IP Command" /></p>

        <p><em>Your ip address will be under <strong>IPv4 Address</strong></em></p>
      </li>
      <li>On <strong>Linux</strong>, open a terminal and enter the command:
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ip addr 
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p><img src="/assets/images/mserv/linux_ip_addr.png" alt="Linux IP Command" /></p>

        <p>In my case, if I wanted to run my server on wifi (not recommended), I would use the ip address located under <strong>wlp3s0</strong>. That is my wireless card.</p>

        <p>If I wanted to run on ethernet (much nicer), I would use the ip address located under <strong>enp0s31f6</strong>. Thats the name of the ethernet port.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Log into your router‚Äôs settings</strong></p>

    <p>You may not know this, but usually routers create their own websites that are only accessible on your network. 
 You can usually connect to this website by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.0.1</code> into your web browser (<em>again this may be different based on your router</em>)</p>

    <p>When you get there, there will likely be a login prompt. You‚Äôre going to have to figure out what that default login and password are, since this is different for each router.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Change your Port Forwarding Settings</strong></p>

    <p>There should be a ‚ÄúPort Forward‚Äù setting for your router. Here, you will have to make use of the <em>server IP address</em> as well as the Minecraft port number (<strong>25525 by default</strong>).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Again, this isn‚Äôt really an all-encompassing setup guide, but it should introduce you to some concepts that will help you out when you‚Äôre ready to try this for yourself.</p>

<p>I encourage you to to do a search and find the specifics for your specific router model.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>As of right now, there are still lots of little typos and inaccuracies within the project. I‚Äôve already found multiple as I write this page üò©</p>

<p>I think once I‚Äôm able to implement CI/CD for this project, little errors like this should iron out much quicker. But, until then, feel free to create an Issue on the <a href="https://github.com/mexiquin/mserv">Github</a> repo, and help me get my priorities straight!</p>
