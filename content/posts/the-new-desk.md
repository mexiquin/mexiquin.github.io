For a long time now, I've been working using various kinds of L-desks, expecting them to provide me with more desk space in a smaller footprint (I work out of my tiny childhood bedroom). I'm coming to realize that, in my case, I'm feeling more cramped than if I were to just use a slab of wood for a desk top. And, in fact, that's exactly what I'm planning to do.  

I've whipped out some quick design concepts using FreeCAD. The design will make use of a single thick wooden board of some kind (It will likely be of repurposed materials, like a door or kitchen counter). This slab will rest on top of two cabinets of the same depth for support.
