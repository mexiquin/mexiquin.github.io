# Experiment Numero 1

The last time I used this hugo theme, I had a problem with new posts not appearing in the __Writings__ headline at the bottom
of the page.  

My hope is that this bug was fixed, or that I actually understand how to use this software now.

**Update**  

From my testing, it appears that everything is working as expected! Thx hugo ðŸ˜Š
