For the first time in a good while, I feel like I've found an ergonomic color scheme suitable for my programming and daily-use needs. I've chosen to use the Gruvbox-Dark color scheme across my entire environment to help save my eyes from strain and maybe even my sanity, as the theme just feels so cozy and warm, but I digress. 

For this post, I plan to outline what customizations I have done to create my preferred Linux computing environment for other people who may want to try, as well as for myself, as I'm quite forgetful.

# 1. The Distribution
As a baseline for the system, I do prefer Arch as my core system. Although I'm also really lazy, so I prefer to use Endeavour OS, as the team has done a great job of providing the Arch experience while also removing quite a few headaches from the install process. This config should still work under vanilla Arch in case you still wanted to go that route. 

I install Endeavour OS with the following preferences:
* i3 window manager
* Printing support
* Bash 
* LTS Linux kernel

# 2. i3 WM tweaking
#TODO
