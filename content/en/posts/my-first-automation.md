Recently, I've been slowly getting more comfortable with managing and developing my tiny little git projects. From my perspective, they're definitely not enterprise-ready by any means. However, I've also been noticing all of the tedious, or just flat-out annoying steps that have to be taken just to accomplish a simple task.  

I come from a video-editing and YouTube-publishing background. My general "production pipeline" consisted of Editing, Rendering, and Publishing. It's simple and it acted as a good subconscious progress indicator, preventing me from overwhelming myself with all sorts of disorganized micro-tasks.  

Now that digital media production is a remnant of my past, and now refocusing my attention on software development, elements of my former workflow still remain. But, of course the software development workflow has to throw me all outta wack.
