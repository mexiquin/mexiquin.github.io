Recently, I've been slowly getting more comfortable with managing and developing my tiny little git projects. From my perspective, they're definitely not enterprise-ready by any means. However, I've also been noticing all of the tedious, or just flat-out annoying steps that have to be taken just to accomplish a simple task.  

I come from a video-editing and YouTube-publishing background. My general "production pipeline" consisted of Editing, Rendering, and Publishing tasks. It's simple and it acted as a good subconscious progress indicator, preventing me from overwhelming myself with all sorts of disorganized micro-tasks.  

Now that digital media production is a remnant of my past, and now refocusing my attention on software development, . But, of course the software development workflow has to throw me all outta wack.
