For a long time now, I've been working using various kinds of L-desks, expecting them to provide me with more desk space in a smaller footprint (I work out of a very small room). I'm coming to realize that, in my case, I'm feeling more cramped than if I were to use just a slab of wood for a desk top. And, in fact, that's exactly what I'm going to do!
