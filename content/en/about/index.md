I’m an amateur software developer, looking forward to learning as much about technology as I can. I also take great interest in topics such as mental & physical health, finance, and overall education.

Here on this website, you’ll be able to find a collection of documents related to me, and what I do. I have a blog that doesn’t follow any particular theme, but I'll do my best to organize and keep everything searchable. Speaking of which, there is a search function here!

I may implement other media formats to share whatever is on my mind, but as of now those are undetermined.
