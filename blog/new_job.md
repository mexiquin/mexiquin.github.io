Its been quite a while since I've last made changes to this website. But for today's quick post, I'm excited to share that I will be working with Dr. Morgan Vigil-Hayes as a research assistant this summer at the [CANIS Lab](https://www.canis-lab.com/) on NAU campus. Its been a good while since I last held a position as a programmer in a professional setting, so I'm very excited to be back in the groove and doing what I do best.
